## Introduction

A few weeks ago I was looking for ideas to start a small project that would allow me to keep on practicing R, the programming language.
  
Somehow I stumbled upon <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/twitteR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TwitteR</a>, an R package by Jeff Gentry. TwitteR provides access to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter API</a>, which allows you to collect information about your tweets.

After finding this, I did a quick research and immediately discovered that Twitter provides a free <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter Analytics</a> dashboard that allows everyone with a Twitter account to get full analytics on their tweets and followers.

**Why would you want to collect information about your tweets?**

By analyzing your Twitter metrics, and measuring your performance over time, you can learn what works and what doesn&#8217;t when it comes to your marketing strategy on the Twitter platform, getting the most from the time and resources you put into posting on Twitter.

## The Twitter Analytics Dashboard

Once you log in to your <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter Analytics</a> account, you&#8217;ll get straight to the dashboard. And on the upper left side of the page you’ll find five main tabs: Home, Tweets, Audiences, Events, and More: Videos (beta), App manager, and Conversion Tracking.

### Home Section

The Home section presents an overview of your activities over a 28 days period. At the top of the page, there is a summary of changes on the number of tweets posted, tweet impressions, profile visits, the number of mentions, and the number of followers, over the previous period.

Right below this summary, you can find a monthly report of highlights, where you can quickly access information about your top performing tweets, top mention, and top follower.

Scrolling down, you will get a similar summary for practically any month you have been on Twitter.

On the right side of the screen, there’s a friendly reminder that you can use Twitter for advertisement.

### Tweets

If you switch to the Tweets section, you&#8217;ll find metrics for every single one of your tweets.
  
At the top of the page, you’ll see a general graph that displays the number of impressions that you got over the past 28 day period. You can change that term by clicking the button at the top right-hand corner.

If you hover over any day in the graph, you’ll be able to see how many impressions your tweets got on a particular day.

On the right side of the chart, you&#8217;ll see the average value of impressions for the month.

![Tweets]({{ "/images/posts/assets/exploring-twitter/follow-me3.png" | absolute_url }})

Scrolling down, you can check the number of impressions, engagement and engagement rate for each of your tweets. You can select the type of tweet you&#8217;d like to explore; the options are all tweets, top tweets (the ones with most impressions), tweets and replies, and promoted tweets.

On the right side of the page, you will find charts summarizing engagement during a 28 days period. More importantly, you will find a breakdown of engagement into link clicks, retweets, likes, and replies.

You can also access a Tweet activity section by clicking on any particular tweet. There you will get detailed metrics only for that tweet.

### Audience Insights

Audiences give you a general overview of who your average follower is. In this section, you can track your follower&#8217;s growth over time. You will also find interesting and highly valuable information about your audience demographics, lifestyle and mobile footprint.

### Events

Here Twitter reminds you of future events people are likely to talk about. You could join in and create campaigns that revolve around these occasions, bringing more engagement and traffic to your site.

### More

**Video Activity** – It’s still in beta version, but this section will allow you to get a better understanding of how your Twitter videos are performing. For example, you can check video completion rate, the total number of complete views divided by the total number of video starts. Out of everyone who watch your video, what percentage of people watched it all?
  
**App Manager** – Allows you to set up your app with Twitter.
  
**Conversion Tracking** – If you use Twitter Ads, you can track your impressions, results, and cost per result across all your different campaign objectives. Conversion tracking allows you to measure return on investment (ROI) by tracking sales and revenue from your Twitter campaigns.

## Important Definitions

Before going any further, it&#8217;s important to understand the meaning of three essential metrics measured by Twitter Analytics. They are defined as follows:

* **Impressions:** The number of times Twitter users see your tweet (either because they appear on their time-line or as a search result). Something to notice is that, even if you have only a few followers, a retweet by someone with a lot more followers than you will grow your number of impressions.

* **Engagements:** Total number of times that someone interacted with a tweet. Interactions that count are clicks anywhere on the tweet, including retweets, replies, follows, likes, links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, profile photo, or tweet expansion.

> Impressions are nice to have, but engagement is better. In the end, you want your impressions and engagement numbers to be as high as possible.

* **Engagement rate:** The number of engagements divided by the number of impressions. This ratio gives a clearer picture of how engaging a tweet is because it factors how many people saw the tweet.

## 5 Ways to Use the Information Provided by Twitter Analytics

After gathering all the information regarding your company profile on Twitter, you are left with series of numbers. Now comes the tricky part – you need to interpret the data collected and use it for improvement. Here are five excellent ways to use the data provided by Twitter Analytics.

### 1. Learn about your audience

**Metrics to track:** Everything in the audiences section, top follower, top mention.

It is impossible to conduct a targeted marketing campaign if you don’t know who you are targeting. Get to know the people who follow you.

In the Audience Insights section, you will get data about your average follower. You will find information about language, gender, age, country of residence, type of device that your followers use to access Twitter, wireless carrier, and even household income. You can also learn about their top interests and on-line purchasing behavior.

> As you get to know more about your audience, you can better identify what content to create and share on Twitter to keep your audience engaged.

Furthermore, if you go back to the Home section, look at your top follower (the person with the greatest number of followers on his own). While this person hasn’t necessarily shared your content yet, he is following you for a reason, and he has the largest potential audience, so you should try to use that information in your favor.

At the same time, you can check your top mention (the tweet with the most impressions, posted by another user, that includes your username). The Twitter user who expanded your reach the most is someone you should reach out to. Send a follow-up, look for opportunities to connect.

### 2. Find out which content your audience enjoy the most.

**Metrics to check:** engagement, engagement rate, link clicks, retweets, likes, replies, top follower’s interests, like rate.

If people don&#8217;t interact with your tweets, you are talking to a void. To find which content resonates with your audience, you have to study your engagement metrics.

#### Different types of engagement
  
Engagement includes any interaction that a user may have with a tweet, whether it’s a click on the tweet, a retweet, a reply, a follow or a like. And those different types of interactions have different meanings. For example:
  
* _A retweet signal value._ Someone found the information that you shared valuable enough to give you access to their audience.
  
* _A like signals appreciation._ If someone liked your tweet, it’s probably because that person thought you had a good idea. Maybe you can make an article or a blog post of that tweet?.

In the Tweets section of your dashboard, you can access a breakdown of engagement quickly and easily for any individual tweet.

#### Which kind of tweet gets the most engagement?

**Media Tweets**
  
Do you share content with photos or videos? According to some studies, <a href="https://adespresso.com/academy/blog/23-strategies-increase-twitter-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photos get a 313% more engagement than regular tweets</a>. Is this true for your audience? It would be interesting to check your embedded media clicks and compare them to link clicks or other type of engagement.

**Tweet length**
  
Twitter already limits your tweets to 140 characters (without counting quotes, polls, videos or images), and this may seem an already short message, but what does your audience prefer? Do they engage more with shorter tweets or with longer tweets? By calculating the length of your tweets and plotting it against engagement, you could pick up some interesting trends.

**Check your content**
  
You have already checked the interests of your average follower. E.g., technology, business and news, tech news, politics, etc. Use this information as a guideline for content and ideas to share. Understanding which type of content and topics your followers enjoy can help you drive your social marketing. Adjust your strategy and publish more of your most successful tweets.

### 3. Understand how people interact with your tweets over time

**Metrics to track:** Impressions, engagement, time, weekday, country of residence

What is the best posting time to maximize impressions (to reach more users)? What is the best posting time to maximize engagement? What is the best day of the week for you to tweet?

There will be certain days of the week, or times of the day, when most of your users will be on-line and are more likely to engage with your content. You should be able to find those peak hours and post during them, that way you’ll get more views, and you’ll be more likely to increase engagement and clicks on your post.

Create plots of impressions vs. time of the day, engagement vs. time of the day, impressions vs. day of the week, and engagement vs. day of the week. You might find some helpful patterns and trends.

Also, look at the country of residence of your average follower, you may get an idea of the time zone in which they’re located. Again, you should post at times that make sense based on when your audience is likely to be on-line.

### 4. Are your Twitter Ads worth the money?

**Metrics to track:** impressions, engagement, engagement rate for promoted tweets, conversion.

Twitter Analytics gives you information about paid and organic tweet performance. If you invested in promoted tweets, you should check the stats for your paid promotions, and compare them to those of your organic tweets.
  
The Conversions section should be handy when measuring your Twitter ads campaign.

### 5. Replicate success and avoid repeating mistakes

Twitter Analytics is a great tool that you can use to figure out what type of tweet work best for you (the one that gets the best results regarding metrics that matter the most to you). Once you know who you are tweeting to, and you have found your successful tweets, identifying the commonalities in them, replicate your success.

But also, don&#8217;t forget to track the poorest performing tweets to learn about what your audience doesn’t want to see.

Look at your follower&#8217;s growth over time. A bigger audience generally leads to higher impressions and clicks.
  
Maybe you&#8217;ll see that at a certain time you lost a significant number of followers. Revisit your activity in those periods and see if you can learn from it. How often were you posting then? What were you posting about? Were you taking the time to reply to other user&#8217;s tweets? Learn from this analysis and avoid the same mistakes in the future.

### Exporting data

Now that you have a better understanding of Twitter Analytics, it&#8217;s time to download the data and play with it.

<p class="caption">
Export data from the Tweets section
</p>

You can export the information about your tweets either from the Twitter Analytics dashboard, as a CSV file, or by accessing the Twitter API.

To export your data, select the time frame that you’d like to explore (note that you can only download data for a 91 days period at a time), and then click the “Export Data” button at the top right corner of the dashboard.

Once you have the CSV file, you can explore the data using the software of your choice (Excel, Google Sheets, R, etc.) to get insights that the platform won&#8217;t provide. For example the analysis to find the peak time to post.

I&#8217;m not using Twitter yet, but I thought I could offer to analyze someone else&#8217;s Twitter data. <a href="https://spendabit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spendabit</a>, the start up that provides a search engine for products that you can buy with Bitcoin, agreed to share its data with me, and my plan is to analyze it in two ways:

  * **With Google Sheets** &#8211; <a href="https://spendabit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spendabit</a> gave me a CSV file containing Twitter data retrieved from the Twitter Analytics dashboard. I&#8217;ll use Google Sheets to explore the data, keeping in mind this guideline to make recommendations.
  * **With R programming language** &#8211; I&#8217;ll access the Twitter API to collect <a href="https://spendabit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spendabit</a>&#8216;s data and then I&#8217;ll analyze it with R, also using this guideline to make recommendations.

I&#8217;ll be publishing both studies in the Projects section of this website. Stay tuned!
