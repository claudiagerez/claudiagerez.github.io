Inspired by Nadieh Bremer's [learning data visualization resources](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/resources/learning-data-visualization), I decided to compile the list of online courses, books, and blog posts that I explored, and found particularly useful, to start my career as a marketing analyst.

The list covers topics such as statistics, data analysis concepts and tools, marketing analytics, and business analytics.  I'm hoping to keep it updated, as I continue exploring the wonderful world of data science!
