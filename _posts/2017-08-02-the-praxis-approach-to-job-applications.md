Last week I found a very interesting opening at a start up company in Toronto.  I got so interested in the company and the role, that instead of following the standard path of applying by sending only a cover letter and my resume, I decided to take the <a href="http://discoverpraxis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Praxis</a> approach, and prepare a value proposition.

*What is a value proposition?*

Well, before creating my pitch, I had to do a little research on the topic myself.  I read more than a dozen of articles before crafting my proposal.  With all the notes I took I prepared this presentation, so now you can learn what a value proposition is and how you can use it to replace your resume when applying for a job.
