Today I started the course [Introduction to Logic](https://www.libertyclassroom.com/courses/introduction-to-logic/), at the Tom Wood&#8217;s Liberty Classroom.  

Here I&#8217;m sharing the notes I took, and what I learned:

  * Aristotle hit upon the idea that the goodness or badness of arguments is independent of their content.
  * There is a small number of types of arguments that are good.
  * When arguments are simple and their subjects uncontroversial, most people get it right.  When they become complex (by introducing semantic complexity, or negations) and/or when the subject matter of the argument is controversial, our native intuitions are prone to error.
  * The heart of logic is inference.
  * Logic is first and foremost, the study of formal argumentation.
  * It’s called formal argumentation because it focuses on the form or structure of the argument, rather than on its content (Aristotelian logic).
  * Formal logic is very powerful, but it’s only part of a wider context for argumentation.

To answer the question of who needs logic.  [Gerard Casey](https://www.mises.org/profile/gerard-n-casey) puts it in one simple sentence: _Anyone who wants to think straight and argue well._
