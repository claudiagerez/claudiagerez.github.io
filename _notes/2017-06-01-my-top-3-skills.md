Month one at Praxis focuses on building your personal brand, that is, your reputation.  It’s easy to understand the importance of a good reputation in a business context.  Strong positive reputations attract more people.  Companies with a good reputation are perceived as providing more value, their customers are more loyal, stakeholders support these companies even in times of controversy.  Companies with a good reputation are believed to deliver sustained earnings, they keep a competitive advantage, and future growth is almost granted.  That’s why many organizations think of their reputation as their greatest asset.

All of this is also true to regular people.  Think of yourself as your own company.  Now, to be able to leave a good memorable impression in others, you need to know yourself.  You have to be sure about who you are, what you do and how you do it.

In this post I’ll tell you more about myself with a focus on my strengths, the skills that I believe make me stand out from the crowd, and that I want others to remember about me.

**1. Researching**

I believe I’m a great researcher.  Whether it’s in academia, at work, or in my daily life; I’m good at finding information from different sources, analyzing it, and making decisions based on my findings.  Researching is also one of the activities that I enjoy the most. The person that is always saying *“I can look that up”* or *“Let me find that for you!”* with a smile on her face, that's me.

A recent example of how I apply this skill is the following one.  Two months ago my husband and I decided to travel to Tartagal (Salta, Argentina) to visit my parents.  I got in charge of finding the best way to get there traveling from Toronto (Canada).  It’s worth noticing that in this particular case, *best* meant most affordable, with a reasonable traveling time.  If you would go to Kayak and look for a direct flight from Toronto to Tarija (Tarija is the city with the closest airport to Tartagal) you would pay around $4000 USD for a round trip, and you would spend about 40 hours traveling one way only.  If you would choose to fly to Salta instead (the second closest city to Tartagal with an airport) and then take a bus to Tartagal, you would end up paying a total of around $1400 USD for the round trip, and you would travel for about 35 hours one way.

I spent a whole morning looking for the different airports close to Tartagal, and then the various combinations between flights and buses that we could take.  I used multiple flight aggregators such as Kayak, Momondo, Skyscanner, Expedia, etc. and played around with several date combinations.  At the end, I found a round trip for $500 USD that would take about 30 hours.  We saved more than 60% on the price of our tickets just because of the research I did.

**2. Organizing**

Organizational skills include in general organizing, planning, time management, scheduling, coordinating resources and meeting deadlines.  I’m quite good at all of those abilities, and I have one example in which I applied them all, it’s about the time when I decided to become my own wedding planner.

About a year and a half ago I was living in Waterloo, Canada, my family was in Argentina, my husband’s family was in the USA, and my best friends were in Costa Rica.  Taking into account visa requirements for everybody, traveling times, and budget; we decided to organize our wedding in Tamarindo, Costa Rica.

I had six months to plan the wedding, and my first step was to list all the things that we needed to get done in that time.  The list included items such as: Approval/Authorization from the catholic church in Costa Rica, Canada, the US, and Argentina.  Creation of a website to keep everybody updated about the event details.  Design of the invitations and delivery of such invitations across five different countries.  Find and secure accommodations for all the guests.  Book a place for the wedding party.  Make sure we would have food, drinks and music at the party.  Book a restaurant to have a wedding reception/lunch.  Find a decorations supplier.  Find a photographer.  Buy a wedding dress.

I tackled every single one of these activities, always considering different options, and keeping an eye on the budget.  My parents-in-law were funding most of the expenses, so I would prepare spreadsheets with different options, summarizing my findings, and I would present it to them to finally make a decision.  After a couple of months working on it, I had it all figured out.  We spent a week in Costa Rica, and had the most wonderful time! But if I have to advice a bride-to-be, I would say... maybe hiring a wedding planner is worth it, it's definitely a time-consuming job!

**3. Adaptability**

Another great skill of mine is how I can quickly adapt to fit new circumstances.  And this is an example of how I apply that skill at work: When I first moved to North America I took a job as a cashier in a Pizza restaurant.  My native language is Spanish, I’m excellent at customer service in Spanish, *could I translate that skill to a different language?* Well, I did my best to do so!  At that job, I focused on learning everything I could about the different pizzas I was selling, I would memorize the ingredients, and ask the chef to describe the cooking technique and the different flavor for me, so I could describe those as he did.  A month passed and I was getting more and more fluent when talking to customers. But then, it happened that two of our cookers quitted, and a few days after that, my boss was asking if I could change my role and start cooking.  I had never stretched dough before, but I had seen them doing it for a month, and I had asked all sort of questions about it.  They really needed help in the kitchen, and I was confident I could learn how to do it, so I took the challenge.  It took me several weeks to get decent at the job, but after two months or so of practice, I was the best at it. I mastered the art of stretching dough, dressing and baking. At the end, I prepare a pizza and have it ready in less than 5 minutes.

Building your brand starts with identifying your strengths, this is quite an important task.  If you know what you’re good at you can leverage those skills in order to achieve your goals.
