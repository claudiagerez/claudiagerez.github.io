Hi! Iâ€™m Claudia.  Throughout my professional life, I have held a wide variety of titles. In the past, I have been a water quality analyst, a researcher, an engineer in the radiation protection and nuclear security field, and an assistant developer and designer.  Currently, <span class="highlight">I work as a marketing data analyst</span> at [The Shipyard](http://theshipyard.com/), a marketing engineering agency.

What motivated all those role changes?  The answer is curiosity.

<span class="highlight">I'm an explorer at heart.</span> When something tickles my fancy, I start doing research, then I make questions, then I try to answer my own questions, and I hypothesize. I do more research; I talk to people, I collect data.  I explore and analyze, and eventually, I find answers that are always backed up by data.

I follow that procedure on all sorts of scenarios, in my daily life and at work, so naturally, I ended up pursuing a career as a data analyst.

In this website, <span class="highlight">I document my journey</span> as a junior data analyst deep diving into the world of digital marketing.
