Hi!  I'm Claudia.  Throughout my professional life I have hold a wide variety of titles. In the past, I have been a water quality analyst, a researcher, an engineer in the radiation protection and nuclear security field, and an assistant developer and designer. Currently, I work as a data analyst at [The Shipyard](http://theshipyard.com/), a marketing engineering agency.

What motivated all those role changes?  The answer is curiosity.

I'm an explorer at heart.  When I get interested in something I do research.  I make questions.  I come out with hypotheses.  I collect, explore, and analyze data to probe those hypotheses. I get feedback. I iterate over my process. I get answers.

I've followed that sort of procedure in all the fields I have worked in, so naturally, I ended up pursuing a career as a data analyst.

In this website, I document my journey as I deep dive into the digital marketing world.
