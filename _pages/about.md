Hi! Iâ€™m Claudia.  Throughout my professional life, I have held a wide variety of titles. In the past, I have been a water quality analyst, researcher, an engineer in the radiation protection and nuclear security field, and an assistant developer and designer.  Currently, I work as a marketing data analyst at [The Shipyard](http://theshipyard.com/), a marketing engineering agency.

What motivated all those role changes?  The answer is curiosity.

I'm an explorer at heart.  When I get interested in something, I make questions and I try to answer them.  I make hypotheses.  I research.  I collect data. I explore and analyze the data to test my hypotheses. I iterate over this process.  I get answers backed up by facts.

I follow that procedure on all sorts of scenarios, so naturally, I ended up pursuing a career as a data analyst.

In this website, I document my journey as a junior data analyst deep diving into the world of digital marketing.
