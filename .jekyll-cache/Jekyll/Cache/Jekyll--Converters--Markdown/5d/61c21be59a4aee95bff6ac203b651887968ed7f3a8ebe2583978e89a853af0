I"#<p>Today I started the course <a href="https://www.libertyclassroom.com/courses/introduction-to-logic/">Introduction to Logic</a>, at the Tom Wood’s Liberty Classroom. </p>

<p>Here I’m sharing the notes I took, and what I learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aristotle hit upon the idea that the goodness or badness of arguments is independent of their content.</li>
  <li>There is a small number of types of arguments that are good.</li>
  <li>When arguments are simple and their subjects uncontroversial, most people get it right.  When they become complex (by introducing semantic complexity, or negations) and/or when the subject matter of the argument is controversial, our native intuitions are prone to error.</li>
  <li>The heart of logic is inference.</li>
  <li>Logic is first and foremost, the study of formal argumentation.</li>
  <li>It’s called formal argumentation because it focuses on the form or structure of the argument, rather than on its content (Aristotelian logic).</li>
  <li>Formal logic is very powerful, but it’s only part of a wider context for argumentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>To answer the question of who needs logic.  <a href="https://www.mises.org/profile/gerard-n-casey">Gerard Casey</a> puts it in one simple sentence: <em>Anyone who wants to think straight and argue well.</em></p>
