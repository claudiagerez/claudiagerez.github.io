I"‹<p>This post is part of the notes Iâ€™m taking from the course Business for Data-Driven Companies.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://claudiagerez.com/2017/06/19/business-metrics-vs-key-performance-indicators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last post</a>, I talked about business metrics and key performance indicators.  Today Iâ€™ll share a convenient way to classify those metrics, that is into the three following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Revenue Metrics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Profitability Metrics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Risk Metrics</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think itâ€™s very practical because with this classification we can relate the metrics to the different areas of the business we might be analyzing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Revenue metrics are always related directly or indirectly to sales.</em> The company sales force and the marketing team are the groups more interested in these values.  <em>How many units of a product were sold over a given period? How does it compare to the same period a year ago? How many people have seen a particular advertisement or email marketing piece? Which percentage responded?</em> etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Profitability metrics</em> are associated with efficiency and logistics, production, and operations.  Profitability <em>is all about efficiency,</em> the ability to use the lowest amount of inputs (energy, effort, money, time, etc.) to create the greatest amount of outputs.  Efficiency is quantitatively determined by the ratio of useful output to total input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Risk metrics</em> relate to risk managers and creditors, and outside investors.  They have to do with tracking, and possibly reducing, the many potential dangers a company faces.  The most important risk metric to track is net cash out.  How many months can the company survive at the present burn rate? Another example is churn rate, the annual percentage rate at which customers stop subscribing to a service.  <em>Risk is closely tied to debt.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An additional classification for business metrics has to do with how quickly they can be modified.  In that case we have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Traditional business metrics.</em> This group includes standard financial and managerial accounting categories.  Traditional metrics vary on long terms, usually on a scale of months to years, and depend on multiple factors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Dynamic metrics</em> can change substantially due to specific actions, in periods of a month or less.  These values can be twitchy, small variations in the business process can have a significant impact on them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Last time I mentioned that the right business question was, <em>What change can be made right now, in the business process, to increase revenue, maximize profitability or reduce risk?.</em>  The answer to that question will always have to do with dynamic metrics.</p>
