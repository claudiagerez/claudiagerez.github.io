I"¶<p>Inspired by Nadieh Bremerâ€™s <a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/resources/learning-data-visualization">learning data visualization resources</a>, I decided to compile the list of online courses, books, and blog posts that I explored, and found particularly useful, to start my career as a marketing analyst.</p>

<p>The list covers topics such as statistics, data analysis concepts and tools, marketing analytics, and business analytics.  Iâ€™m hoping to keep it updated, as I continue exploring the wonderful world of data science!</p>
