<p>I‚Äôm currently auditing the online course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-business-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Metrics for Data-Driven Companies</a>, by Duke University at Coursera.  The course aims to introduce the best practices for how to use data analysis to make any company more competitive and profitable.</p>

<p>As a way of keeping accountability, I‚Äôve decided to make a summary of what I find interesting during the lessons, and share it here, as a blog post.  Today I‚Äôll talk about the difference between business metrics and key performance indicators.</p>

<h2 id="business-metrics">Business Metrics</h2>

<p>According to Daniel Egger, professor of the course, <em>the best use of a business analyst (or a business data analyst) in a company is that he or she is the person that knows which is the right question to ask</em>.  After identifying the question, this person will find the best answer to it with the resources presently available in the company; and the solution will translate to a call to action, having a practical impact on the business processes.</p>

<p><em>What‚Äôs the right question? It‚Äôs what change should be made right now (or as soon as possible) in the business process to increase revenue, maximize profitability, or reduce risk.</em></p>

<p>How does this relate to business metrics? Metrics are numbers that help us answer the right business question.  We can have an impact on these quantities, whenever we make changes to our business processes, we change metrics.  For example, we can consider the number of people that signs up for the newsletter on our website as a business metric.  Let‚Äôs say we are trying to increase the number of subscribers, we could add the sign-up button to every page on our website, and this could lead to an increase in the number of subscribers.  A tax rate ‚Äì as an opposite example ‚Äì is NOT a metric; we can‚Äôt change it.</p>

<p><em>A business metric is a quantifiable measure that can be used to track and assess the status of a particular business process.  We can use business metrics to evaluate the performance of our business process.</em></p>

<h2 id="key-performance-indicators-kpis">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>

<p>If we define success in terms of making progress toward strategic goals, we can say that <em>KPIs are performance metrics intended to measure success at reaching targets.</em>  You have to evaluate KPIs over a specified period of time and compare them against past performance metrics or acceptable standards.</p>

<p><em>The benefit of a real KPI is that it highlights areas that need attention, providing executives with meaningful information to make better decisions.</em></p>

<p>Going back to the previous example of trying to increase the number of subscribers to our newsletter.  In that case, a good KPI would be the newsletter sign-up conversion rate.  That is, the number of visitors who completed the form divided by the number of people who just saw it.  Now we need a target, let‚Äôs say, the newsletter sign-up conversion rate should grow by a 5% compared to the value of last year, or we could measure it against the percentage increase in leads that the sales team is targeting.</p>

<p>With the information gathered, we can think of actions to take.  To increase the number of people completing the form maybe we have to make the form simpler to fill in, or make the newsletter free, or add sign-up buttons on every page of the website.  Here there‚Äôs room for experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h2>

<p>Business metrics are quantifiable measurements in an organization.  With metrics you think broad, with KPI you think deep.  KPI are business metrics that target critical areas of performance.  For example, a metric may monitor website traffic, whereas a KPI would monitor how website traffic contributed to incremental sales.</p>

<p>Good business metrics are comparative.  A 5% conversion rate doesn‚Äôt say much if you don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to.  Also, they should be rates or ratios, that makes it comparable It must be simple to understand.  Everyone should know what the metric measures.  Good KPIs drive action, they highlight areas of the business that need attention.</p>

<p><em>Something to think about: What KPIs are the critical few that drive value for your organization?</em></p>
