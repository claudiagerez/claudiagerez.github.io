I"«<p>Month two at Praxis is about learning how to write clearly and persuasively.  To achieve this goal, participants are challenged to write and publish a blog post every day for a month.  Iâ€™m on day 4, and I have to confess Iâ€™m not enjoying this challenge very much.</p>

<p>My negative thoughts came out from day 1.  I only have a few hours per day to dedicate to this task; I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s enough time to produce quality pieces of writing.  Besides, English is not my native language, that means that every time I write, I have to double and triple check for spelling and grammar mistakes, that takes time, the time I have to write is not enough!.  Shouldnâ€™t I be investing the few hours that I have free in learning something more related to data analytics (the career I want to pursue)?</p>

<p>The truth is that writing for an online audience is not one of my strengths.  And precisely for that reason, I can see the benefits of getting better at it.  Wouldnâ€™t it be great if I could become more fluent/faster when writing in English? Isnâ€™t it true that writing in a clear and concise way is important in any professional environment? Communication skills are quite important in data analysis, after all, any results achieved have to be translated into an understandable document.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m facing resistance.  And I have to fight it.  The plan to win this battle is to organize my schedule.  Find a few hours per day to write and commit to sit and produce.  Also, Iâ€™ll have to compromise and write simpler posts when the time is scarce, planning for the topics that require more work.</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™m sorry, but Iâ€™ll have to put a stop to this post, Iâ€™m in the middle of a road trip, and cars in motion make me feel a little sick.  But these are the hours I allocated for writing, and I have to do what I have to do to overcome the 30-day writing challenge!  Iâ€™ll post this as soon as we stop somewhere where WiFi is available.</p>
