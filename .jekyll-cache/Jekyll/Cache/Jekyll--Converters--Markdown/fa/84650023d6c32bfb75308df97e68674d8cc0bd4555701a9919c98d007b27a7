I"<p>Infographics, or information graphics, take complex data, information or knowledge, and translate it to easy-to-understand graphic visual representations.  They are intended to present information quickly and clearly. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic#cite_note-Ref2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></p>

<p>Infographics check three core requirements of effective communication: <em>appeal, comprehension, and retention</em>.</p>

<p><strong>1. Appeal</strong></p>

<p>Infographics capture attention.  Researchers have found that colorful visuals increase a person‚Äôs willingness to read content by an 80%. <a href="https://blog.snappa.com/types-of-infographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a> Designers are well aware of the importance of color psychology in marketing and branding. Furthermore, 60% of our brain is involved in visual functioning <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/the-language-of/9781492017257/ch41s02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a>.  Reading text is a visual task, but the brain processes an image 60.000 times much faster than plain text.</p>

<p><strong>2. Comprehension</strong></p>

<p>How often do you hear someone claim to be a ‚Äúvisual learner‚Äù? It only means that that person needs to see something to be able to understand it.  Infographics break down complex data into easily digestible chunks and rely on highly visual content to make it more understandable.</p>

<p><strong>3. Retention</strong></p>

<p>Infographics also make it easy to retain information.  People will remember 65% of information that is combined with related images three days later, while if they only hear the information, they‚Äôll retain only a 10%. <a href="http://www.lifelearn.com/2015/05/12/why-infographics-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4]</a></p>

<p>I‚Äôve always wanted to design an infographic, so I went ahead and created one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I chose a topic, one of Argentinian‚Äôs favorite drinks:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernet">fernet</a>.</li>
  <li>I shopped around for a free tool to build infographics <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/infographic/tools-2131971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5]</a> ‚Äì I picked <a href="https://piktochart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picktochart</a>.</li>
  <li>I reviewed the different types of infographics available, and chose a template.</li>
  <li>I sketched a simple design on paper, and then put the idea on the website playing with the color scheme suggestions from <a href="https://coolors.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coolors.co</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result can be found at the bottom of this page, what do you think?</p>
